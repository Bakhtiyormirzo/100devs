//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["In It To Win It", "Fight to the Finish", "Worldwide Cheersmack"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let size = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = movies[size - 1]
